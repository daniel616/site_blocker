Modify restrictions by going to extension options.
You can hard block sites or simply make the blocker issue a warning when you visit said sites.
You can allow certain sites to be accessed based on day of week, day of month or time of day. 
One common use case might be to allow sites only to be accessed on Saturday, Sunday, between 
11:30 and 1PM, and after 5PM.
