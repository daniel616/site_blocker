<h1>Change restrictions</h1>
<p>Any hostnames containg a restricted expression may get blocked.
For example, if I block "facebook","facebook.fakedomain",
    "dfacebook.com" and "www.facebook.com" will also get
blocked. So don't block something like "a". You can allow sites to be visited at multiple
times of day, days of the week, or days of the month.</p>
<p>It is recommended that you set up minimal restrictions by only blocking things at certain times or
    using "warn only" as opposed to hard blocks. This prevents you from feeling the urge to disable the blocker or
    modify the blocker settings later on.</p>
<p>Validation of settings has not been implemented yet. Make sure your inputs make sense.</p>
